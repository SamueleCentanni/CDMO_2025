\section{Conclusion}

Across CP, SAT, SMT, and MIP, we used the same circular matching method to fix weekly pairings and focus the search on periods and home/away.
This allowed us to scale up to including $n = 20$ in the most effective approaches.
Also, significant gains came from symmetry breaking: fixing rotations, team labels, and a simple home/away pattern prevented exploration of equivalent schedules.
Quantatively, it enabled us to solve $n=16$ to optimality in CP, and for some cases gave 4-7x speedups in SAT, around 2-3x in SMT, while in MIP the circular formulation already removed most symmetries.
In short, circular matching plus symmetry breaking plus a max imbalance objective minimization is a clear, reliable recipe that performed consistently across all reported approaches.
