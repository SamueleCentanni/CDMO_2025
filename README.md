# CDMO_2025
Combinatorial Decision Making and Optimization to solve the Sport Tournament Scheduling (STS)

## SMT 

### Usage:
python decisional.py <n> <approach_base> [--sb_disabled]

approach_base is just the name of the approach string displayed in json
--sb_disabled flag will disable symmetry breaking, otherwise enabled by default

### Examples:

1.
python decisional.py 16 z3_decisional_but_also_optimal_by_graph_theory 
will run decisional version for n=16
and append the results to json in res/SMT
where z3_decisional_but_also_optimal_by_graph_theory is just the name of the approach in json
add --sb_disabled flag to disable symmetry breaking

2.
python optimal.py 16 z3_optimal
will run decisional version for n=16
and append the results to json in res/SMT

usually both versions can do up to n=20 in less than 5 minutes

3.
python solution_checker.py res/SMT
would run professor's checker to validate the satisfaction
of all the constraints, but not optimality

4.to check optimality we have our own checker
python check_optimality.py res\SMT

## SAT - 🏆 Sport Tournament Scheduling with Z3

This repository provides an implementation of the **Sport Tournament Scheduling (STS)** problem using the Z3 SMT solver. It supports a variety of constraint encodings and includes both **decisional** and **optimization** solving modes.

### 📦 Features

- 📌 Supports **Exactly-One** encodings:

  - `np`: Naive Pairwise
  - `bw`: Binary Encoding
  - `seq`: Sequential Encoding
  - `heule`: Heule's Recursive Encoding

- 📌 Supports **At-Most-K** encodings:

  - `np`: Naive Pairwise
  - `seq`: Sequential Counter
  - `totalizer`: Totalizer Tree Encoding

- ✅ Fixed calendar generation via the **Circle Method**
- 🧩 Symmetry breaking to reduce the search space
- 🔎 Both **optimization** (MinMax imbalance) and **decisional** (find any solution) modes
- 📄 JSON output for result storage and analysis

### 📊 Output

- 🖨️ **Human-readable schedule** printed to console
- 📁 **JSON files** with:
  - `sol`: schedule matrix
  - `obj`: objective value (MinMax imbalance)
  - `optimal`: whether proven optimal
  - `time`: time taken
  - Solver statistics: conflicts, memory, etc.

### 📘 Model Description

#### Problem

- Schedule a **round-robin tournament** for `n` teams (even).
- Each team plays all others exactly once.
- Matches must be assigned to one of `n/2` periods in `n-1` weeks.
- Respect max home/away imbalance (`max_diff_k`).

#### Constraints

- Each match assigned to **exactly one** period
- Each period in a week has **exactly one** match
- Each team appears **at most twice** in the same period (global)
- **Home/away imbalance** limited by `max_diff_k`
- Optional symmetry breaking:
  - Fix a match in week 0
  - Alternate home/away for Team 0
  - Lexicographic ordering in week 0

### 📚 Encodings Implemented

#### Exactly-One Encodings

- **Naive Pairwise (np)**: Pairwise mutual exclusion
- **Binary (bw)**: Binary auxiliary variables
- **Sequential (seq)**: Using auxiliary sequential bits
- **Heule**: Recursive grouping + auxiliary variables

#### At-Most-K Encodings

- **Naive Pairwise (np)**: Pairwise for k+1 combinations
- **Sequential (seq)**: Sequential counter using auxiliary variables
- **Totalizer**: Tree-merge counters with propagation constraints

---

### 🧪 Benchmarks

You can test various encoding combinations using `--all`, which evaluates the following:

| Exactly-One | At-Most-K   |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `np`        | `np`        |
| `heule`     | `seq`       |
| `heule`     | `totalizer` |

### 📁 Output Example

Example JSON output structure:

```json
{
  "heule_seq": {
    "time": 27,
    "optimal": true,
    "obj": 1,
    "sol": [[[1,2], [3,4], ...], [...]],
    "max_diff": 1,
    "restarts": 12,
    "conflicts": 489,
    "mk_bool_var": 2048,
    "max_memory": 13.7
  }
}
```

---

### 🔍 Notes

- `n` must be **even**.
- The solver uses Z3 with `random_seed=42` for determinism.
- The calendar is **fixed** using the circle method (only periods and home/away need assignment).
